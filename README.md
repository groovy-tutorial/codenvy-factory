# Welcome

This is a basic Codenvy environment for trying out Groovy scripts.

Activation URL: <https://codenvy.com/f?id=ywk05vqoj59g5gyl>

Once opened in Codenvy, you should see a console section running in the lower
pane of the application. This is setting up a container with Groovy ready to go.

You can try out Groovy by opening the `Terminal` tab and typing:

    groovy -e "println 'hello, world'"

The project files are accessible in the terminal by changing directory to the
`project` directory:

    cd project

You can then try the demo script:

    groovy hello.groovy

You can start to prepare your own scripts in the IDE by creating new files -
these will be reflected in the `Terminal` under the `project` directory.

## Important note
The Codenvy workspace is temporary and closing the project or browser window
will cause any changes you've made to be lost. If you'd like to keep the
workspace, click on the `Persist` button in the top-right of the IDE.

For help in using Codenvy, please refer to their [User Guide](http://docs.codenvy-stg.com/user/).
